It is pre defined data strcutures in java.
It stores data in linear form.
It is a dynamic size.
primitive data type can't be stored directly.

for eg. in a array we need to store data of  students , we need to define the number 
of students of our class for example 5 , so our array will be arr[5];
so a modification mechanism is needed in array if we need to add more students,
so arraylist is the dynamic allocation of array.

ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(); //declaration of a arraylist.

like the above declaration we can also do it for Boolean , String

We can do following in arraylist:-
a. add element
b. get element
c. remove element 
d. set element by index
e. contain element
